# Josephson-Junction-Neurons
This is a project to simulate neural network by using Josephson junctions. In this project, we implement Runge-Kutta method to solve non-ordinary differential equations. And we reproduce the results in paper **Crotty, Patrick, Dan Schult, and Ken Segall. "Josephson junction simulation of neurons." Physical Review E 82.1 (2010): 011914.** Source codes and figures are in the directory "Python_source_code_and_figure". We summarize some content in the paper and our result in the report.pdf.
